# Neural-Networks-Basics
This contains the basics of neural networks and deep learning using Tensorflow. This code can be a good introduction and guide for getting started with Tensorflow.
we will manually build out a neural network that mimics the TensorFlow API. This will greatly help your understanding when working with the real TensorFlow!
